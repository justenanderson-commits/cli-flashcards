# Flaschcards Solo Project
## Abstract:
This is a flashcards game that will be run in the command line interface (CLI). It cycles through 30 multiple-choice questions that the user can answer, then a final score of correct answers is offered at the end. 

## Installation Instructions:
1. Go to [this repo](https://github.com/justenanderson-commits/cli-flashcards) on Github
2. Click Fork > Create New Fork
3. Click Code
4. Copy the SSH url provided by GitHub
5. In the terminal, navigate to the new project repository
6. Type git clone and paste the URL
7. Type `node index.js` in the terminal
8. Play the game by typing the number of your guess and pressing `enter`. A score will print to the CLI when all 30 questions have been answered.

## Preview of App:


## Context:
Working independently in the 1st weeks of Mod2 classes at Turing, I invested at least 25 - 30 hours to create this application's functionality from scratch using  Javascript. The Mocha framework and chai Library were used for testing.

## Contributor:
- [Justen Anderson](https://github.com/justenanderson-commits)

## Learning Goals:
- Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
- Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
- Implement ES6 classes
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

## Tech Used:
- GitHub
- Terminal
- VS Code
- Chrome Browser/Dev tools
- Zoom
- Slack
- Mocha
- Chai

### Additional Notes:
- Trying to interpret the project spec was very difficult. Trying to figure out how to write a test for a function that wasn't yet written and whose description was hard to interpret was extremely challenging. I attempted to maintain fidelity of the testing first, writing the implementation code second throughout the entire project, but definitely hit a wall at the game.start() method.
